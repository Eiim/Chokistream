**Describe the bug**
Describe the issue you're having. Add screenshots if applicable.

**Steps taken**
* For streaming issues, did you try a different mod (HzMod/NTR/ChirunoMod) or mod version (in particular with HzMod)? Issues which only occur with one mod or mod version are generally still valid, but it helps greatly in debugging them, and can provide a temporary workaround.
* For connection issues, have you tried pinging the 3DS IP from your computer?
  * Windows: open command prompt and type "ping " followed by the IP. If it says "Request timed out" then it's not a Chokistream issue, but we might still be able to help.
  * Linux/Mac: open the terminal and type "ping " followed by the IP. If it doesn't send out messages every second or so to the terminal, and when cancelling with ctrl+c it has a packet loss anything substantially above 0%, then it's not a Chokistream issue, but we may still be able to help.
 * For all issues, have you tried a different streaming client? This isn't terribly important, but if an issue occurs with multiple clients then it's likely not a Chokistream issue.

**Versions/settings**
 * Chokistream version
 * OS
 * HzMod/NTR/ChirunoMod version (on the 3DS)
 * New 3DS or original 3DS?
 * Games where the issue is encountered, if applicable

Take screenshots of the Chokistream settings, including mod settings, and put them here.
